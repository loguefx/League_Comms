# Quick Start Development

## Build First, Then Start

```bash
# 1. Build API
cd ~/League_Comms/apps/api
npm run build

# 2. Check it worked
ls dist
# Should see main.js

# 3. Start dev
cd ~/League_Comms
npm run dev
```

## That's It!

Once `npm run dev` starts, you'll see:
- API: http://localhost:4000
- Web: http://localhost:3000

Open the web app in your browser and test it!
